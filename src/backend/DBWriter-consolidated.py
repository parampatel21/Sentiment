# ISSUES:
#   1. Need to consolidate all functions into one master function
#   2. Need to figure out how to authenticate Firebase Storage and Firestore (either from client side in function parameter or in cloud function)
#   3. Find a way to setup Github Actions to deploy straight to firebase functions
#       i. probably this thing: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cloud-functions-deploy
